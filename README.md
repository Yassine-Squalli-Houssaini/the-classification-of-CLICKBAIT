In the scope of our project, we focused on the classification of article titles as clickbait or non-clickbait by applying various machine learning algorithms. This project will result in a report and an oral presentation.

Beyond learning to work collaboratively as a group, the objective was to expand our scientific and technological knowledge. As we discovered, machine learning combines computer science and mathematics. For our team, it was a complete exploration of text data preprocessing techniques.

Our initial goal was to discover and understand these techniques to proceed with their implementation and apply different learning algorithms to the processed data. The ultimate objective of our project was to compare these learning algorithms and create the best classification model.

## text-classification

Text classification is a machine learning technique that assigns a predefined set of categories to open text. Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize almost any type of text, ranging from documents and medical studies to files and the web.

For example, news articles can be organized by topics, support tickets can be organized by urgency, chat conversations can be organized by language, brand mentions can be organized by sentiment, and so on. Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with extensive applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.

## Text Preprocessing Techniques

Text preprocessing plays a vital role in text classification. We discuss commonly used techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization/stemming, and text normalization. These steps help clean and prepare the textual data before model training.

## EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis

Before constructing classification models, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step includes exploring descriptive statistics, visualizing the data, and identifying trends or patterns in the dataset.

## Feature Extraction

In this section, we explore different feature extraction methods to represent clickbait titles. We discuss the use of techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and other text-specific features to capture relevant information for classification.

## Training Different Classification Models

We train several commonly used classification models, such as Naive Bayes classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks. We detail the training, evaluation, and optimization steps for each model.

## Comparison of Classification Models

In this part, we compare the performance of different classification models using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and identify the best model for clickbait title classification.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for clickbait title classification. We have explored different text preprocessing techniques, extracted relevant features, and trained multiple classification models. The results demonstrate the importance of choosing the right approach to address the clickbait classification problem.
