## Introduction

In this study, we explore the classification of clickbait titles using machine learning approaches. Clickbait refers to a style of title that aims to grab users' attention using sensationalist or misleading techniques. Our goal is to develop an efficient classification model that can distinguish clickbait titles from others.

## Text Classification

This section explains the fundamental concepts of text classification and presents the different approaches used in this project. We cover techniques such as the bag-of-words model, language models, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for text classification.

## Text Preprocessing Techniques

Text preprocessing plays a vital role in text classification. We discuss commonly used techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization/stemming, and text normalization. These steps help clean and prepare the textual data before model training.

## EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis

Before constructing classification models, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step includes exploring descriptive statistics, visualizing the data, and identifying trends or patterns in the dataset.

## Feature Extraction

In this section, we explore different feature extraction methods to represent clickbait titles. We discuss the use of techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and other text-specific features to capture relevant information for classification.

## Training Different Classification Models

We train several commonly used classification models, such as Naive Bayes classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks. We detail the training, evaluation, and optimization steps for each model.

## Comparison of Classification Models

In this part, we compare the performance of different classification models using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and identify the best model for clickbait title classification.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for clickbait title classification. We have explored different text preprocessing techniques, extracted relevant features, and trained multiple classification models. The results demonstrate the importance of choosing the right approach to address the clickbait classification problem.
